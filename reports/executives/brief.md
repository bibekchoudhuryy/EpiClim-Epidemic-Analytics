# Policy Brief — Epidemic Burden in India (EpiClim Dataset)

**Scope:** Weekly district-wise epidemic + climate data, 2009–Present.

---

## Findings

1. **Data Quality**
   - Climate indicators (precipitation, LAI, temp) have 20–40% missingness.
   - Epidemiological counts are more complete.

2. **Burden**
   - Top 15 districts show >200 cases per 100k per week on average.
   - States like Delhi and Tripura shows the highest no of cases as compared to their populattion.

3. **Trends**
   - Epidemic waves cluster seasonally; rolling averages + uncertainty bands suggest **monsoon correlation**.

4. **Mortality**
   - Mortality rate >4% in States like Assam(9%),Meshalaya(7%),bihar(6%) far above national avarage (2.2%).
   - Resource prioritization needed for high-mortality zones.

## Policy Recommendations

- **Targeted allocation:** Prioritize funding to top 15 high-burden districts.
- **Mortality hotspots:** Urgent intervention in high-mortality states.
- **Data strengthening:** Improve climate-health integration (missingness).
- **Seasonal prep:** Stockpile & mobilize resources before monsoon season.

## Checklist for Decision Makers
- [ ] Are high-burden districts receiving extra funding?
- [ ] Are mortality hotspots flagged for clinical capacity building?
- [ ] Is there a pre-monsoon epidemic preparedness plan?
- [ ] Is data completeness monitored monthly?
